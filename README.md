# Data-Augmentation-for-Visual-Question-Answering

This project was done for the course ['Natural Language Understanding and Computational Semantics'](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mkB6KA7KuzNeoc9jW3mfOthv_6Uberxs8l2H7BmJdzg/edit) at NYU CDS in Spring 2018.
It aims at increasing the accuracy of VQA models by augmenting the dataset. The paper written as a result can be found [here](https://github.com/infinite-pursuits/Data-Augmentation-for-Visual-Question-Answering/blob/master/data-augmentation-visual.pdf).
